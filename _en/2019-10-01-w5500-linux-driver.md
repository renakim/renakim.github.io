## Linux kernel

While searching for the WIZnet W5500 linux driver, I noticed a W5500 update in the linux kernel github repository.

Entering through the commit ID seems to have been updated since **v5.2-rc3**.

- Link: [Linux kernel (drivers/net/ethernet/wiznet)](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/ethernet/wiznet){:target="\_blank"}

The commit comment is shown below, and the description shows that the device tree of w5x00 is supported.

```
net: ethernet: wiznet: w5X00 add device tree support

The w5X00 chip provides an SPI to Ethernet inteface. This patch allows
platform devices to be defined through the device tree.
...
```

As the device tree support was added, the following document files were added.

- [Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/wiznet%2Cw5x00.txt](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/wiznet%2Cw5x00.txt){:target="\_blank"}

The above file is a guide for writing DTS. It consists of descriptions and basic examples of property values to use W5x00.

If you want to use the W5500 in a Linux environment, this is a good reference.

## Raspberry Pi kernel

The kernel of Raspberry Pi is applied to the rpi-5.3.y branch. (There is no devicetree doc file in 5.2.y.)
